# neural-style-transfer-for-images

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. It merges two images namely, a `content image (C)` and a `style image (S)`, to create a `generated image (G)`. The generated image G combines the **content** of the image C with the **style** of image S.

For example, let’s take an image of this turtle and Katsushika Hokusai's `The Great Wave off Kanagawa`:

Style transfer is an interesting technique that showcases the capabilities and internal representations of neural networks.

Another example for this is below

For example, let’s take an image of this `dog` and `Wassily Kandinsky's Composition 7`:

Now how would it look like if Kandinsky decided to paint the picture of this Dog exclusively with this style? Something like this?
